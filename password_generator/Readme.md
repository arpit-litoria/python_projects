# 🔑 Password Generator

Welcome to the **Password Generator**! This Python script creates a strong, randomized password based on user-defined criteria, ensuring your accounts stay secure.

## 📜 Overview

The Password Generator allows you to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers you want in your password. It combines these elements randomly to create a secure password that is both unique and hard to guess.

## 🚀 Features

- Generates a password using a specified number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Ensures that the requested numbers are within the available character limits.
- Randomizes the order of characters for added security.

## ⚙️ How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Character Pool Definition**: It defines pools of characters for letters, symbols, and numbers using Python's `string` module.
2. **Input Validation**: Checks that the requested number of characters does not exceed the available characters in each pool.
3. **Random Selection**: It randomly selects the specified number of characters from each pool.
4. **Shuffling**: The selected characters are shuffled to ensure randomness.
5. **Password Generation**: The characters are combined into a single string to form the final password.

## 📦 Installation

To use the Password Generator, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This script does not require any external libraries.
